# Tournament Scheduler Using Genetic Algorithms
This project generates and optimizes tournament schedules using Genetic Algorithms (GAs).

## Features
- Supports round-robin and knockout formats
- Minimizes venue conflicts and ensures fair conditions
- Visualizes schedules as Gantt charts or tables

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the scheduler:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/ga/`: Core GA logic
- `src/utils/`: Input parsing and visualization
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Results
Simulation results and comparisons with baseline solutions will be saved in the `results/` directory.
